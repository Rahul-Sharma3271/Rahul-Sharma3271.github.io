1. There was too many unwanted files in php mailer so i removed them..
   PHPMailer is now moved to /res/phpmailer/

2. Simply Go to http://localhost/Github/Rahul-Sharma3271.github.io/mail/ and check mail functionality

3. I always get confused whenever i read your code.. i didn't understand your coding style.. 
   You write half code for anything and another half for anithing else. Your variables didn't match your database and database dosen't match with coding.. :)
   So.... i was unable to write any query for your code
   
4. OTP will be generated and validated by my code and you just have to write your queries where i commented for that.
