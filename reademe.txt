1. There was too many unwanted files in php mailer so i removed them..
   PHPMailer is now moved to /res/phpmailer/
2. Your mail file was using post method so i created a file /mail/tmp.php for testing
   Just go to /mail/tmp.php run it in browser enter your email and click to submit to test mailing..
